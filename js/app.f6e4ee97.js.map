With such a wealth of scenery, it is no surprise that outdoor recreation is a popular activity for both residents and visitors of the PNW. For many, natural beauty is only a short distance away.

These lands have remained free from human development, and, over time, have been subject to a variety of regulations and protections. But outdoor recreation extends beyond land conservation and policy. The economic benefits of outdoor recreation are just beginning to be understood. Within the PNW, as of 2017, over 450,000 people work within outdoor recreation, and consumers spend over $50 billion annually on recreation services.

Recreation often requires such intersectional considerations, which are posed to become only more complicated as time goes on. Equity also remains a primary concern for recreation departments.
