          "facts":["Hypoxic zones, otherwise known as Dead Zones, are areas of the ocean with little to no oxygen. More specificially, they are areas where dissolved oxygen levels are lower than 1.4 ml/L, which is considered to be lethal for many organisms. These zones tend to occur in lower parts of the water column, and are highly seasonal. Off the Pacific Northwest coast, hypoxia is more likely to occur in the summer months, when upwelling brings high-nutrient, low-oxygen water from the depths to the surface. The nutrient influx causes an explosion of phytoplankton, and when these organisms decompose, they further reduce the oxygen supply. Hypoxia is becoming more frequent due to climate change."]
